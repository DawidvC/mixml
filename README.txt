MixML prototype implementation

Based on: Derek Dreyer, Andreas Rossberg, "Mixin' Up the ML Module System"

(c) 2007-2008 Andreas Rossberg


Requirements
------------

You need a working installation of SML/NJ (including ML-Yacc and ML-Lex).

Building
--------

Just invoke "make".

Usage
-----

Simply invoke ./mixml from the command line. The synopsis is:

  mixml [-c|t|v|x|h] [files...]

It will process the files given. If none are given, enters an interactive prompt.

Options are:

  -c  type-check only
  -t  type-check only, but with tracing messages from the type checker
  -v  evaluate (default)
  -x  evaluate in checked mode (type checks whole program after every step - very slow!)
  -h  print command usage

Language
--------

The file syntax.pdf shows the complete syntax that is currently understood, including
the desugaring rules into the bare calculus as presented in the paper. Hopefully, it
is sufficiently self-explanatory.

Bugs
----

I'm sure there are plenty. Please mail rossberg@mpi-sws.mpg.de if you find any.
